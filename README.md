# Lesson Up

## Functionality (MVP):
- makes lesson planning easy and painless with a simple form consisting of checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, and minimal input fields.
- takes user input and converts to a lesson plan layout which the user can print to pdf.
- print functionality/layout will be optimized using CSS media queries.

## API for curriculm standards data:
- common core curriculum API: https://commonstandardsproject.com/developers

## Stretch functionality:
- offer different user input fields for different educator roles (general education vs. special education).
- offer different lesson plan layouts/styles and options for customization (colors, formatting).


## Further future expansion ideas:
- implement document conversion capabilities or integration with GoogleDocs.
- expand as full-stack application with authentication/user log-in.
- implement photo-upload capability.
