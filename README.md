# Lesson Up

## Functionality (MVP):
- Makes lesson planning for k-12 public school educators easy and painless.
- Users can create, save, search, and print lesson plans for each grade level and content area they teach.
- Takes user input and converts to a lesson plan layout which the user can print to pdf.
- Print functionality/layout optimized using CSS media queries.

## API for curriculm standards data:
- common core curriculum API: https://commonstandardsproject.com/developers

## Stretch functionality:
- offer different user input fields for different educator roles (general education vs. special education).
- offer different lesson plan layouts/styles and options for customization (colors, formatting).


## Further future expansion ideas:
- implement document conversion capabilities or integration with GoogleDocs.
- expand as full-stack application with authentication/user log-in.
- implement photo-upload capability.
